**Highlights**

- 🤖 Introducing `st.status` to display output from long-running processes and external API calls ([#7140](https://github.com/streamlit/streamlit/pull/7140)). Works great with `st.chat_message`. See our [documentation](https://docs.streamlit.io/library/api-reference/status/st.status) for how to use this feature.
- 🚥 Introducing [`st.toggle`](https://docs.streamlit.io/library/api-reference/widgets/st.toggle) — an alternative to `st.checkbox` when you need an on/off switch.
