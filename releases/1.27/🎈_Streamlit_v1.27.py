**Highlights**

- ✨ Introducing `st.scatter_chart` — a new, simple chart element to build scatter charts Streamlit-y fast and easy! See our [documentation](https://docs.streamlit.io/library/api-reference/charts/st.scatter_chart).
- 🔗 Introducing `st.link_button`! Want to open an external link in a new tab with a bit more pizazz than a plain text link? Check out our [documentation](https://docs.streamlit.io/library/api-reference/widgets/st.link_button) to see how.
- 🏃 Announcing the general availability of `st.rerun`, a command to interrupt your script and trigger an immediate rerun.

**Notable Changes**

- 👻 You can initialize widgets with an empty state by setting `None` as an initial value for `st.number_input`, `st.selectbox`, `st.date_input`, `st.time_input`, `st.radio`, `st.text_input`, and `st.text_area`!
- 📤 `st.download_button` now uses `target="_self"` instead of opening a new tab ([#7151](https://github.com/streamlit/streamlit/pull/7151), [#7132](https://github.com/streamlit/streamlit/issues/7132)).
- 🧟 Removed unmaintained `pympler` dependency ([#7193](https://github.com/streamlit/streamlit/pull/7193), [#7131](https://github.com/streamlit/streamlit/issues/7131)). Thanks, [rudyardrichter](https://github.com/rudyardrichter)!
